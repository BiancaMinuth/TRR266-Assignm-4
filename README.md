## EXCHANGE RATES
Exchange rates were retrieved from WRDS using SAS: 
Go to WRDS --> SASStudio --> open: "comp_exchange rates" ('code/SAS/comp_exchange rates.sas') --> run the code.
Saved as 'exch_rates.csv' ('data/generated/exch_rates.csv').

## USING R FOR DATA ANALYSIS
Open 'code_assignm4' (code/R/code_assignm4'). --> run the code.
ExPanD was used for displaying the results and is the basis for Table 1: Regression Analysis in the presentation, but are also shown by the subsequent Linear regression model in the code (tab_reg_1, tab_reg_2)
Selceted figures display the results as well.
